Developed to follow the steps typically encountered in a cell migration experiment, *CellMissy* is composed of three modules:

 * _Experiment manager_: set-up a new cell migration/invasion experiment
 * _Data Loader_: import and store motility data
 * _Data Analyzer_: explore and analyze motility data

The main unit around which these three modules are built is the experiment: clicking on the *_Experiment_* menu, three items are shown. Each of these items corresponds to a module and is described in more detail below.

== Create a new experiment ==
This module guides you through the design of a cell migration/invasion experiment. After having chosen a project to which the experiment is going to belong, and having provided a number and a short description for the experiment, you can define its set-up on a multi-well plate view. Common multi-well plate formats are rendered on the view, namely 96 (8 columns x 12 rows), 48 (6 x 8), 24 (4 x 6), 12 (3 x  4), 6 (2 x 3). Here, groups of wells (or individual wells) can be selected to define biological conditions. Please note that wells within such a group are taken to be technical replicates in further data loading/analysis. A list keeps track of how many biological conditions are being defined for the current experiment and, once a condition is added to the list, a color is automatically assigned to it. Different informative metadata variables can be chosen for each biological condition in the right panel of the GUI. Here, three tabs show different views according to the variables to be chosen:
 * _Cell Line_: here the cell line used in the experiment can be chosen; you can define and customize parameters such as seeding density (number of cells _per_ well), growth medium and serum.
 * _Assay_ECM_: here you can characterize the Extra Cellular Matrix (ECM), in terms of dimensionality (are you designing a _migration_ or an _invasion_ experiment?), coating type, coating temperature and so on. 
 * _Treatments_: the last tab gives you the possibility to add any kind of treatment or compound to your biological condition, specifying for example the concentration and the presence of any drug solvent.
Once the experimental set-up is finalized, you can export the design as a PDF document that can be used as a reference in the lab while conducting the experiment.
Then, the plate lay-out, well assignments and related metadata are all stored in the database. 
== Load motility data... ==
After defining the experimental set-up, the next step is the import of the relevant cell motion data. Data import and storage in CellMissy can be based on CELLMIA output as well as the generic motility tracking input format. See following sections for more details.
=== ... from CELLMIA ===
The import and storage of motility data that were generated by CELLMIA (http://www.dcilabs.com/Software.php) is fully automated in CellMissy. Once you select the experiment for which you want to import and store the data, CellMissy looks for a file generated at microscope imaging time; this file has a _.obsep_ extension (see http://loci.wisc.edu/software/bio-formats for further information), and contains the experiment metadata information, as well as the names and the metadata of imaging types used during the image recording and the names of the positions list(s) defined and generated. If the file is not in the right folder or more than one files are present, you can select a file to associate to the current session. Once these metadata are retrieved, CellMissy processes the CELLMIA text files: all you have to do is to click on the first well that was imaged for first; all the others wells will be automatically highlighted (if imaged), according to the position list associated to the current imaging type. The plate view can be reset at any time and the import can be cancelled for a certain bench of data. Once the import is finished, you can save the motility data to the database.
=== ... from generic input ===
If you use any other package for segmentation and image processing, you can import motility data from a generic input file. In this case, CellMissy expects at least one tab-separated text file for each well, containing one record per line, and two columns per record. The first column holds the time information (this can be minutes or simply time sequence steps) and the second column the area values (these can be expressed in Âµm^2^, pixels or percentage %). You can start the import adding names for datasets and imaging types of interest. One dataset could e.g. stand for a collection of motility data generated through a specific algorithm of image processing. Once an imaging type is added to the session, it is automatically added to each dataset. However, a well (or a biological condition) can have been imaged with only a specific imaging technique, or a certain dataset been generated only for a specific group of conditions. That's why CellMissy does not require every combination of dataset/imaging type to be supplied for each well. Furthermore, you can load load multiple files per well, even for a certain combination of dataset/imaging type, allowing the use of multiple imaging locations within the well. A table underneath the plate view keeps track of the imported area values, together with current dataset, imaging type, and well's column, row. Once the import is done, and experiment metadata are supplied, you can start storing the data.
