/**
 * This class makes use of "SSJ: Stochastic Simulation in Java" library from iro.umontreal.ca to compute estimation of kernel density estimation of an array of double
 * It first generates independent and identically distributed random variables from the dataset, at which the density needs to be computed
 * and then generates the vector of density estimates at the corresponding variables.
 * 
 * The KernelDensityGen class from the same library is used: the class implements random variate generators for distributions
 * obtained via kernel density estimation methods from a set of n individual observations x1,..., xn.
 * The basic idea is to center a copy of the same symmetric density at each observation and take an equally weighted mixture of the n copies as an estimator of the density
 * from which the observations come. The resulting kernel density has the general form: fn(x) = (1/nh)âˆ‘i=1nk((x - xi)/h).
 * K is the kernel and h is the bandwidth (smoothing factor).
